# Git
**Steps to add your project first time to a repo**

Go to your folder and open a terminal. 

Type
**git init**

This will initialize git in that folder. Then you should add your GitHub repository you created early as a remote repository to enable push code to it and also pull from it. 


Do:
**git remote add origin <YourLink>**

you can check if the repository you add is correctly placed as your remote repository

**git remote -v**

Then add your file(s) to the staging area

**git add .**

and commit your changes to create a history of commits and enable you to push

**git commit -m "commit message"**

then you can push your file(s) to your remote repository

**git push origin master**

Go and refresh your Github repository and you'll see your file(s) there.

# After first time setup keep pushing code through Android Studio/VSCode/Github Desktop
